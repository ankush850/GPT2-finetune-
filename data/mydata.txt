### Advanced Reasoning and Problem-Solving

A farmer has a fox, a chicken, and a bag of grain. He needs to cross a river with a small boat that can only carry him and one other thing. If the fox and the chicken are left alone, the fox will eat the chicken. If the chicken and the grain are left alone, the chicken will eat the grain. How does he get everything across safely?
First, the farmer takes the chicken across and leaves it on the far side. He returns alone. Then, he takes the fox across. He leaves the fox on the far side but brings the chicken back with him. He then leaves the chicken on the near side and takes the grain across. He leaves the grain with the fox on the far side. Finally, he returns alone to get the chicken and takes it across again.

If all humans who are 18 years or older are considered adults, and a person becomes 18 exactly on their birthday, is a person an adult on the day of their 18th birthday?
Yes, a person becomes an adult on the very day they turn 18 years old. The moment their birth date occurs, they have reached the age of 18.

A train leaves station A for station B at 60 mph. Two hours later, another train leaves station B for station A at 80 mph. The distance between A and B is 500 miles. How long after the second train leaves will the two trains meet?
Let t be the time in hours after the second train leaves. The first train has been traveling for t+2 hours at 60 mph, so it has covered 60(t+2) miles. The second train has covered 80t miles. The sum of these distances must equal the total distance: 60(t+2) + 80t = 500. Solving: 60t + 120 + 80t = 500 -> 140t = 380 -> t = 380/140 ≈ 2.714 hours, or about 2 hours and 43 minutes.

What is the difference between correlation and causation? Provide an example.
Correlation means two variables are statistically associated. Causation means one variable directly causes the change in another. Example: Ice cream sales and drowning incidents are correlated (both increase in summer), but one does not cause the other. The hidden causal factor is the hot weather, which leads to more people both eating ice cream and swimming (sometimes leading to drowning).

Explain the Monty Hall problem and why switching doors is the better strategy.
A contestant picks one of three doors, behind one is a car and behind the other two are goats. The host, who knows what's behind the doors, opens another door, always revealing a goat. The contestant is then given the choice to stick with their original door or switch to the remaining unopened door. Switching doors gives a 2/3 probability of winning the car, while staying gives only a 1/3 probability. This is because the host's action provides additional information, and switching effectively means you get the car if you were initially wrong (a 2/3 chance).

### Creative and Technical Generation

Write a Python function that takes a list of numbers and returns a new list with only the prime numbers.
```python
def is_prime(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    if n == 2:
        return True
    if n % 2 == 0:
        return False
    i = 3
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
        i += 2
    return True

def filter_primes(numbers):
    return [num for num in numbers if is_prime(num)]
